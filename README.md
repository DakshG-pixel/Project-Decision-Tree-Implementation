## Decision Tree Implementation
This project provides an implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm using Python. The Decision Tree is a widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
This implementation allows you to build a decision tree model from a given dataset and make predictions on new data points. This decision tree model is used on the iris dataset which is a multi class classification problem.

Features
Constructs a decision tree from a training dataset from scratch without using any predefined library models.
Supports both categorical and numerical features
Handles missing values in the dataset
Performs classification tasks
Calculates various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision
Visualizes the constructed decision tree
Installation
To use this decision tree implementation, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can clone this repository or download the project files as a ZIP archive.

Dataset Overview:
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Each sample belongs to one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.
The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and serves as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

Load and preprocess the dataset:
Update the code to load your dataset.
Preprocess the dataset if necessary (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
Use a suitable method to split your dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., train-test split from scikit-learn).

Train the decision tree model:
Pass the training data and corresponding labels to the DecisionTreeClassifier class in decision_tree.py.
Call the fit() method to train the decision tree model.

Evaluate the model:
Use the trained decision tree to make predictions on the testing data.
Calculate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to assess the performance of the model.

Visualization of the Decision Tree:
Visualized the decision tree using the graphviz and pydotplus libraries.
Saved the decision tree visualization as a PDF file.
